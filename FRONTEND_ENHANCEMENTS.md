  visible: {
    opacity: 1,
    transition: {
      duration: 0.6,
      staggerChildren: 0.1
    }
  }
};
```

### 2. Item Variants
```javascript
const itemVariants = {
  hidden: { y: 20, opacity: 0 },
  visible: {
    y: 0,
    opacity: 1,
    transition: {
      duration: 0.5,
      ease: "easeOut"
    }
  }
};
```

### 3. Hover Effects
```javascript
const buttonVariants = {
  hover: {
    scale: 1.05,
    transition: { duration: 0.2 }
  },
  tap: {
    scale: 0.95
  }
};
```

## üé® CSS Enhancements

## üåü UX Improvements

### 1. Loading States
- **Before:** Generic loading messages
- **After:** Operation-specific spinners with contextual messages
- **Enhancement:** Users know exactly what's happening

### 2. Notifications
- **Before:** Basic toast notifications
- **After:** Animated notifications with confetti celebrations

### 3. Reduced Motion Support
- Respects user's `prefers-reduced-motion` setting
- Graceful degradation for accessibility

## üéØ Status Indicator Enhancements

### Color-Coded Status System
```javascript
const statusConfig = {
  'pending_scan': { color: '#6b7280', icon: '‚è≥' },
  'scanning': { color: '#f59e0b', icon: 'üîç' },
  'scanned': { color: '#3b82f6', icon: '‚úÖ' },

### Best Practices Applied
- Consistent animation timing (0.3s for quick interactions, 0.6s for page loads)
- Easing curves for natural motion feel
- Staggered animations for list items
- Loading state management with proper cleanup

## üéâ Success Celebrations

### Confetti Triggers
- Project creation success
- File upload completion
- Scan operation started
- Conversion completed
- Download initiated

showNotification(
  'Project created successfully! üöÄ', 
  'success', 
  { celebration: true }
);
```

## üìà Performance Impact
